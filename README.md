# A Beginner's Friendly Introduction to Diffusion Models in JAX
This repository contains a beginner-friendly introduction to diffusion models in JAX.

## Prerequisites
- Knowledge of Python and Numpy
- Undergraduate-level knowledge of probability and linear algebra


## Getting Started

If you would like to run the code yourself, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adonath/jax-diffusion-models-pydata-boston-2025.git
cd jax-diffusion-models-pydata-boston-2025
```


```bash
uv venv jax-diffusion-models-pydata-boston-2025
source jax-diffusion-models-pydata-boston-2025/bin/activate
```

Otherwise you can just run the code in Google Colab at the link below:
