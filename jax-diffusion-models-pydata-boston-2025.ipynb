    "## What are Diffusion Models?\n",
    "Diffusion models are a class of generative models that are based on the concept of iteratively removing noise from an image\n",
    "or other data. \"Generative\" means they model a probability distribution and can be used to draw new samples from the distribution and thus generate new plausible images. Or an alternative way of thinking about diffusion models is to think of them as sampling algorithms, that sample from a fixed distribution. Where the distribution we sample from is defined by the distribution of the data we use for training them. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/sde_schematic.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Image taken from: https://yang-song.net/blog/2021/score/\n",
    "\n",
    "However sampling from high dimensional distributions, such as the distribution of natural images, where each pixel is treated as an independent dimension, can be technically quite challenging. Diffusion models are a way to make this sampling process feasible and scalable. Diffusion model are mathematically well founded and draw many parallels to actual physical diffusion processes, \n",
    "denoising methods in image processing as well as theory of (stochastic) differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial We will take a look at a specific type of diffusion models called Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) introduced by [Ho et al. in 2020.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239). We will use simple \"toy examples\" on 1d and 2d data to illustrate and understand the method. The goal is to build intuition and provide a solid foundation for working with production scale models. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: I personally find that \"diffusion models\" are to a certain degree a misnomer, as the relevant part of the model is the reverse process, where the diffuson process is inverted. But we will learn about that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is JAX?\n",
    "In a single sentence you can think of JAX as Numpy with support for GPUs and automatic differentiation.\n",
    "It also includes a just in time compilation (JIT) and function transforms, such as vectorization (like np.vectorize)\n",
    "which is automatically lowered to hardware accelerated XLA (XLA is an open source compiler for linear algebra / machine learnin)\n",
    "instructions. \n",

    "## Warm Up: the Diffusion Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffusion is typically a physical process where particles spread from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration over time, driven by random motion. In nature, this can be seen in phenomena like the dispersal of ink in water or the flow of heat through a solid. Mathematically, diffusion is often modeled using stochastic processes or differential equations, capturing how randomness leads to gradual smoothing and homogenization of an initial state. In a more general understanding diffusion can also include convection, meaning a systematic drift of the particles driven by an external force, such as wind, a gravity driven flow in water, or stiring in a mixing process. \n",

Howevere there is one important difference: **array objects in JAX are not mutable**, meaning they cannot be modified in place. Something like `array[2:3] = 3`, **does not work** in JAX, for reasons that become clear later, when we dicuss just in time compilation (JIT). There is a handful  more of these differences which are documented in [\"JAX - The Sharp Bits\"](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html).\n",

    "**Note on pure functions**: Functions passed to `jax.lax.scan` are automatically JIT compiled, which allows for efficient execution. However this requires functions to be \"pure\" or alternatively they cannot have \"side effects\". Side effects include e.g. modifying an object / data that was passed to the function as argument in place,  printing something or interacting with global state in the function. This limitation becomes clear, when you remind yourself that for JIT compilation the Python code only serves as a laguage to define the computational graph and is never really executed. Instead a JIT compiled version of the code is executed, which is compiled to lower level hardware accelerated code. How should a remote GPU \"know\" how to modify a specific Python object in thh main process place? This would require supporting complex communication between process and platforms. The requirement of pure functions makes the implementation of the JIT much simpler and more stable.\n",
